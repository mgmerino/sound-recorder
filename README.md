# Annotated vibe code
## Intro

This is an experiment about AI-based learning process.

The idea is to vibe code an simple program (in this case, an audio recorder),
and then manually annotate (using AI to explore the concepts) every line in
the source code, explaining what it does and why does it that way. I expect to
push myself to get into Linux Systems Programming and get a bit of knowledge
about Rust.

I am aware that Rust is a huge gap for a web developer, but I want to take the
risk.

The second step is me to write my own version without help, beyond online
documentation, but no AI-generated code in this step.
